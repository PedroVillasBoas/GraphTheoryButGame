- **Graph Order**: See the amount of vertices at all times!
- **Graph Size**: Check how many vertices you can create!
- **Camera Control**: Pan and zoom the camera within bounds.
- **Smart Vertex Spawning**: Vertices spawn within specified areas, preferring ground over water.
- **Copy Vertex ID**: Right-click a vertex to copy its ID to your clipboard.

## üéÆ Getting Started

You can use Grafudos in 2 ways:
1. **Executable**
   - You can just download the [Grafudos Zip File](Grafudos.zip) file, extract it anywhere and launch the `Grafudos.exe` executable.
   - The program will launch and you can start exploring Grafudos!

2. **Unity Editor**
   - To use Grafudos in Unity Engine follow the steps bellow.

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2020.3 or later.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PedroVillasBoas/GraphTheoryButGame.git
   ```

2. **Open in Unity**

   - Launch Unity Hub.
   - Click on "Open" and navigate to the cloned repository folder.

3. **Play**

   - Press the Play button in Unity to start the application.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Use

### Adding Vertices

- **Automatic ID**: Click the "Add Vertex" button without entering an ID to generate a random vertex.
- **Custom ID**: Enter a unique integer ID in the vertex ID field and click "Add Vertex".

### Removing Vertices

- Enter the ID of the vertex you wish to remove and click "Remove Vertex".

### Adding Edges

- Enter the IDs of two existing vertices in the edge fields.
- Enter a weight if the graph is weighted.
- Click "Add Edge" to connect them.

### Removing Edges

- Enter the IDs of the two vertices connected by the edge.
- Click "Remove Edge" to delete the edge.

### Adjusting Physics

- Use the sliders to adjust:
  - **Center Force**: Pulls vertices towards the center.
  - **Repel Force**: Pushes vertices away from each other.
  - **Link Force**: Controls the stiffness of the edges.
- Click "Toggle Physics" to pause/resume the simulation.

### Dragging Vertices

- Click and hold a vertex to drag it around.
- Release the mouse button to drop the vertex.

### Shortest Path

- Enter the start and end vertex IDs.
- Click "Find Shortest Path" to calculate and highlight the path.

### Vertex Degree

- Enter a vertex ID and click "Get Degree" to see its degree.
- For directed graphs, in-degree and out-degree are displayed.

### Adjacency Check

- Enter two vertex IDs.
- Click "Check Adjacency" to see if they're connected.

### Camera Controls

- **Pan**: Click and hold the middle mouse button to move around.
- **Zoom**: Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
- **Bounds**: Camera movement is constrained within the watery bounds‚Äîno escaping into the void!

### Copying Vertex ID

- Right-click on a vertex to copy its ID to your clipboard.
- Paste it anywhere‚Äîsend it to a friend or keep it for your records!

## üåä The Environment

The graph resides in a world divided into three layers:

1. **Water**: The watery abyss. Vertices can spawn here but prefer land.
2. **Ground**: Solid ground where vertices feel most at home.
3. **Props**: Decorative elements to make the graph feel alive.

Vertices prefer to spawn on the ground but will venture into the water if necessary. Don't worry; they can swim! üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## ‚öôÔ∏è Behind the Scenes

### Centralized Physics

All physics calculations are centralized in the `GraphManager`. This approach ensures efficient computations and smooth simulations, even when handling large graphs.

### Real-Time Physics Adjustment

The physics sliders are wired directly to the simulation parameters. Adjusting them changes the behavior of the vertices in real-time‚Äîno need to restart!

### Drag-and-Drop

Dragging vertices uses Unity's event system. When you pick up a vertex, it becomes kinematic, ignoring physics forces until you drop it back into the world.

### Camera Constraints

The camera is smart! It knows the boundaries of the watery world and won't let you peek beyond the edges, no matter how hard you pan or zoom.

### Smart Spawning

When adding new vertices, the system searches for valid positions within the water tilemap, preferring ground tiles. This ensures your graph doesn't spill over into uncharted territories.

### Copy-Paste IDs

Right-clicking a vertex uses Unity's `GUIUtility.systemCopyBuffer` to copy the vertex ID. Handy for quickly referencing specific nodes.

## üß© Extensibility

Want to add new features? The code is organized and commented for easy navigation. Feel free to fork the repository and customize it to your heart's content!

## üêû Troubleshooting

- **Vertices Not Moving?** Make sure physics is enabled and that your physics parameters aren't set to zero.
- **Can't Add Edge?** Ensure both vertex IDs exist and aren't the same.
- **Camera Won't Pan?** Remember, panning is done with the middle mouse button, and the camera won't go beyond the water's edge.
